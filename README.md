This code defines a function `calc_ulator()` that implements a basic calculator.
It allows users to input two numbers and choose an operation (+, -, *, /, or **) to perform.
The function then calculates and displays the result.
It also includes an option for users to perform another calculation or exit the program.
The calculator runs in a loop until the user chooses to stop.
